# Dynamic Car Animation

This Python application, built with the Tkinter library, demonstrates a simple animation of cars moving across a canvas. It's designed to teach basic GUI development concepts in Python.

## Features

- Start and stop the animation of cars with custom speed control.
- Run all cars simultaneously or sequentially with one click.
- Reset all cars to their original positions.

## Learning Material

The module focuses on several key aspects of Python GUI development using Tkinter:

- **Basic Tkinter Widgets**: Introduction to Tkinter widgets like Canvas, Label, Button, Scale, and Radiobutton.
- **Event Handling**: Binding actions to GUI elements, such as starting an animation with a button click.
- **Animation Techniques**: Creating simple animations by moving objects on the canvas.
- **Layout Management**: Positioning widgets within the window using pack, grid, and place.
- **Python Basics**: Structuring the GUI application using loops, functions, and classes.
- **Callback Functions**: Using callback functions for actions like animations or state changes.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes with Python)

## Usage
